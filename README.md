This is a .NET Windows Forms control library featuring random controls I have made. There is no real theme, just stuff I needed or wanted to make. It has a flat button, a flat slider, a flat marquee + normal progress bar, a Windows 7 colorable progress bar and a grid.

The controls are mostly used for a custom project of a friend of mine called Invoice Azurite.
